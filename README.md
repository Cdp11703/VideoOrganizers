# VideoOrganizers
This repository contains a collection of small Python utility scripts used for organizing, managing, and playing local video (anime) files. The scripts automate common tasks such as generating playlists, organizing episodes into folders, playing videos via mpv, and flattening directory structures by moving video files.
